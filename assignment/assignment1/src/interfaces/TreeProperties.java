	public boolean isBinary();
	// is the tree a binary tree?

	// is the tree a proper binary tree?
	// every position in a proper binary tree has either zero or two children

	public boolean isComplete();
	// is the tree complete?
	// a complete tree is one where:
	// 1) all the levels except the last must be full 
	// 2) all leaves in the last level are filled from left to right (no gaps)

	public boolean isBalanced();
	// is the tree balanced?
	// a balanced tree is one where the depth of any two leaves differs by no more than one.

	public boolean isHeap(boolean min);
	// is the tree a min-heap (if min is True), or is the tree a max-heap (if min is False)
	// heaps are trees which are both complete and have the heap property:
	// in a min-heap, the value of a node is less than or equal to the value of each of its children
	// similarly, in a max-heap the value of a node is greater than or equal to the value of each child

	public boolean isBinarySearchTree();
	// is the tree a binary search tree?
	// a binary search tree is a binary tree such that for any node with value v:
	// - if there is a left child (child 0 is not null), it contains a value strictly less than v.
	// - if there is a right child (child 1 is not null), it contains a value strictly greater than v.
